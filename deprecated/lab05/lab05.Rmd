## Question 2 - Starwars Characters

Investigate the data set starwars. Answer the following

> - How many characters are listed?
> - What kind of data is the mass column?
> - What kind of data is the species column?
> - Explain what the value NA means in the hair_color column.
> - How many characters are from Tatooine?
> - For humans, what is the average (mean) age?

```{r}
## number of characters?
nrow(starwars)
## Mass (probably in kg) is "numeric" or quantitative
class(starwars$mass)
## Species is character data, which is categorical/nominal.
class(starwars$species)

## NA represents missing values. Many of these characters are robots or other kinds of species that have no hair.

## Characters from Tatooine
filter(starwars, homeworld == "Tatooine") |> nrow()

## Common mistake: use length(), length() gives you column numbers
filter(starwars, homeworld == "Tatooine") |> length()

## average birth year for human
filter(starwars, species == "Human") |> summarize( mean(birth_year, na.rm = TRUE))

```


## Questions 3

Create a scatter plot of the columns height and mass from the starwars data set. What jumps out from the plot? Do a little investigation to find out about that point.

```{r}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point()
```

Humans should point out that large point. What is this?

```{r}
filter(starwars, mass > 500)
```

Create a data set that excludes the outlier from the previous question. Plot the relationship for height and mass again. Add a smoothed regression line. Interpret these results for the nature of relationship between height and mass.

```{r}
starwars_small <- filter(starwars, mass < 500)
ggplot(data = starwars_small, aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() # stat_smooth also ok
```


## Question 4

Suppose we are interested in seasonal effects on the housing market. Here is a plot of median housing prices by month in Texas over the period 2000 to mid-2015.

```{r}
ggplot(txhousing, aes(x = month, y = median)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

What might be misleading about this plot? Refer to section 3.9 of R for Data Science to propose a better way of displaying these data. Comment on any seasonal effects you see.

Solution

Since the plot places January and December on opposite ends, we might not notice a winter seasonal effect. One solution is to change the coordinate system.

```{r}
ggplot(txhousing, aes(x = month, y = median)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + coord_polar()
```

Create a plot that summarizes the number of listings for each city. For each city, show the minimum number of listings in a month, the maximum, and the median.

Solution

```{r}
ggplot(data = txhousing, aes(x = listings, y = city)) +
  stat_summary(fun = median, fun.min= min, fun.max = max) 
```


## Today's Content

> - Today's lab combines both conceptual problems and coding
> - Covers topics covered until last week: (ggplot, data manipulation...)


## Problem 1

> - Take a glimpse at the first six rows of the `mpg` data.
> - What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r mpg, exercise = T}
head(mpg)
```

```{r classVsdrv,  exercise = T}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Answer: 
The resulting scatterplot has only a few points.
A scatter plot is not a useful display of these variables since both `drv` and `class` are categorical variables. Since categorical variables typically take a small number of values, there are a limited number of unique combinations of `(x, y)` values that can be displayed. In this data, `drv` takes 3 values and `class` takes 7 values, meaning that there are only 21 values that could be plotted on a scatterplot of `drv` vs. `class`. In this data, there 12 values of (drv, class) are observed. Scatter plots are prefered for visualizing two continuous variables.



## Problem 2

> - Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
> - How would you fix this problem (use the code cell below)? 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```


```{r aesthetics, exercise = T}
## fix the problem
```

## Answer:
The argument `colour = "blue"` is included within the mapping argument, and as such, it is treated as an aesthetic, which is a mapping between a variable and a value. To fix this, keep color out of the aesthetics attribute.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```


## Problem 3
 > - What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
 > - Use the plot below as a hint.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ cty)
```


## Answer:

The continuous variable is converted to a categorical variable, and the plot contains a facet for each distinct value.

## Problem 4

## Problem 5
> - We have learned that the `filter()` is used to  subset observations (rows) based on their values.
> - Consider the flight data:

```{r flights}
head(flights, n = 3)
str(flights)
```

> - How would you find all flights that:
> - Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (need to convert time from hrs to mins)? ***[Hint: look up the `arr_delay` variable.]***

```{r arrival, exercise = T}
## your answer here
```

> -  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)? ***[Hint: look up the `dest` variable]***

```{r destination, exercise = T}
## your answer here
```

> -  Were operated by United (UA), American (AA), or Delta (DL)? ***[Hint: look up the `carrier`]***

```{r airlines, exercise = T}
## your answer here
```

## Answer:
> -  An arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r arrival_sol, exercise = T}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```


> -  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)?

```{r destination_sol, exercise = T}
filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")


## Or Preferably
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
```

> - Were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r airlines_sol, exercise = T}
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))
```


## Problem 6
> - We are interested in selecting the following columns:
> - `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from the `flights` data.
> - John proposes the use of 
```
select(flights, all_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")))
```
> - while Jane proposes:
```
select(flights, any_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")))
```

> - They are unsure if they will get same answers. Without running any of the codes, do you think they will get same answers? Explain.

## Answer:
> - Yes, they will get the same answers. The difference between the two functions is that, `all_of()` throws an error when a variable is missing in the dataframe while `any_of()` does not. 

> - The example codes confirms that they yield same output.

```{r all_of, exercise = T}
select(flights, all_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")))
```

```{r any_of, exercise = T}
select(flights, any_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")))
```


> - Now compare the two codes below
> - Here, I add a variable that is not in the `flights` data -- "`petal`"
> - Note that `all_of()` breaks completely
while `any_of()` selects those columns that exist in the dataset.

```{r all_of_err, exercise = T}
select(flights, all_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay", "petal")))
```

```{r any_of_err, exercise = T}
select(flights, any_of(c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay", "petal")))
```


## Problem 7
> - Sam wants to compute the sample skewness defined by.

$$
Skew(x) = \dfrac{\frac{1}{n-1}( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^3)}{Var(x)^{3/2}}
$$

> - She writes her codes as follows, following the DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle

```
skewness <- function(x) {
  n  <- length(x)
  m  <- mean(x)
  v  <- var(x)
  dev_cub <- (x - m) ^ 3
  (sum(dev_cub) / (n - 2)) / v ^ (3 / 2)
}
```
> - She is confident that her functions works and tries it on

```
x <- c(4, 5, 8, 1, 4 , 7 , 8)
```

> - Jesse thinks something might go wrong if he supplied the following data

```
y <- c(5, 6, 2, 9, NA)
```

> - Is Jesse's claim true? Why would it work or not without running Sam's codes?


> - if you agree with Jesse, how would you fix this problem?

```{r Sam, exercise = T}
#### Your code here
```



## Answer:
Jesse is right! The function breaks on his data because there is an `NA`. Since `NA` is not a number, we cannot take the average of the vector (you cannot sum numbers and NAs). A solution is to allow for the `na.rm` argument in the function.

```{r Sam_sol, exercise = T}
#### Fix
skewness <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  n <- length(x)
  m <- mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  v <- var(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  dev_cub <- (x - m) ^ 3
  (sum(dev_cub, na.rm = na.rm) / (n - 2)) / v ^ (3 / 2)
}

y <- c(5, 6, 2, 9, 7, 2, 5, NA)
skewness(y, na.rm = TRUE)
```
