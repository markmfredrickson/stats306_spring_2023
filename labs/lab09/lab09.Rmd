## Strings and Regular Expressions

### Strings

Recall that a string is character data enclosed in double `"` or single `'` quotes. In R, strings exist in character vectors.
```{r}
words[1:5]
```

The `stringr` package contains many useful functions for working with strings. In lecture, we went over some commonly used `stringr` functions.

`str_c()` is used to concatenate strings. These strings can be given in separate vectors, in which case the `sep` argument should be used to control what goes between consecutive strings.
```{r}
str_c("lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my!", sep = ", ")
```

`str_c()` can also be given a single vector of strings. In this case, the `collapse` argument should be used to control what goes between consecutive strings.
```{r}
parts <- c("lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my!")
str_c(parts, collapse = ", ")
```

`str_length()` essentially returns the number of characters in a string.
```{r}
str_length("My favorite colors are maize and blue.")
```

`str_sub()` extracts a substring of a string. `start` and `end` are the indices of the starting and ending characters of the substring.
```{r}
str_sub("November", start = 3, end = 6)
```

`str_split()` splits a string into substrings given a separator. Note that it returns a list.
```{r}
str_split("lions, tigers, bears, oh my!", pattern = ", ")
```

**Exercise:** Using the vector `base::LETTERS`, make a vector with 25 strings in which the first string is `"A precedes B"`, the second string is `"B precedes C"`, etc.

```{r str_c, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r str_c-hint}
# Note that LETTERS[-1] contains B through Z
LETTERS[-1]
```

```{r str_c-solution}
str_c(LETTERS[-26], "precedes", LETTERS[-1], sep = " ")
```

### Regular Expressions

A *regular expression* is a string specifying a pattern that other strings may or may not match. Regular expressions can be used to

  - find strings matching a pattern
  - modify substrings matching a pattern
  - delete substrings matching a pattern

**Exercise:** Write a regex that matches `"this"` and `"the"` but not `"third"`. Use it to extract all instances of the two words from the paragraph below, which is stored in `baseball`.

```
According to Baseball Reference’s wins above average, The Red Sox had the best 
outfield in baseball— one-tenth of a win ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers, 11.5 to 11.4. And 
that’s despite, I’d argue, the two best position players in the NL this year (Christian 
Yelich and Lorenzo Cain) being Brewers outfielders. More importantly, the distance from 
Boston and Milwaukee to the third-place Yankees is about five wins. Two-thirds of the Los 
Angeles Angels’ outfield is Mike Trout (the best player in baseball) and Justin Upton (a 
four-time All-Star who hit 30 home runs and posted a 122 OPS+ and .348 wOba this year), 
and in order to get to 11.5 WAA, the Angels’ outfield would have had to replace right 
fielder Kole Calhoun with one of the three best outfielders in baseball this year by WAA.
```

```{r regex-setup, include=TRUE}

and in order to get to 11.5 WAA, the Angels’ outfield would have had to replace right 
fielder Kole Calhoun with one of the three best outfielders in baseball this year by WAA."
```

```

```{r regex-hint}
str_extract_all(...)
```

```{r regex-solution}
str_extract_all(baseball, "th(e|is)")
str_extract_all(baseball, "(t|T)h(e|is)") # including capitalized T
```

## EDA
- In the previous labs, we learned about variation (for a single variable) and covariation (for two or more variables)

- We learned how to visualize univariate distributions depending on the type of variable:
  + Categorical/Discrete Variables - `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()` and pie charts
  + Continuous - `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, `geom_freqpoly()`
  
- For bivariate distributions we looked at a combination of variable types:
  + Continuous-continuous - `geom_point()`, `geom_contour()`
  + Continuous-Discrete (also known as conditional distributions) - `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_violin()`
  + Discrete-discrete - `geom_count()`, `geom_tile()`
  
Let us answer the following question   


**Exercise** Using the `iris` dataset, use an appropriate plot to explore the relationship between `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`. What do you learn about this plot for the various `Species`?
```{r iris, exercise = TRUE}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r iris-hint}
# (a) What variable types are we exploring?
# (b) What would be an appropriate plot to visualize the relationship
# (c) How do you condition on `species`?
```

```{r iris-solution}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, col = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

#%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Observations %%%%%%%%%%
# From the above plot, we can infer that:

# (1) Species Setosa has smaller sepal lengths but larger sepal widths.
# (2) Versicolor Species lies in the middle of the other two species in terms of sepal length and width
# (3) Species Virginica has larger sepal lengths but smaller sepal widths.
```


    
## Data Imports
- We have previously discussed that data may be available to us for analysis in two major forms: creating them ourselves and importing them from other sources.   
- The major sources of data for importation are summarized in the figure below.

</center>

- For the purpose of this class, we narrowed our focus on flat files from the `readr` package.
- Specifically, we have explored using some functions as:
  + `read_csv` - for comma separated values
  + `read_tsv` - for tab separated values
  + `read_delim` - for general delimiters (could be comma, semi-colon, tab, pipe or any delimiter)
  
- Let us answer the following questions based on what we have learned about these functions.

### Question 1 {.tabset}

#### Question 
What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with
"|"?

#### Answer

Use the `read_delim()` function with the argument `delim="|"`
```
Use the read_delim() function with the argument delim="|"
```



### Question 2 {.tabset}

#### Question 
Apart from `file`, `skip`, and `comment`, what other arguments do `read_csv()` and `read_tsv()` have in common?

#### Answer
They have the following arguments in common:
```{r DIQ2, exercise = TRUE}
intersect(names(formals(read_csv)), names(formals(read_tsv)))
```



### Question 3 {.tabset}

#### Question 
Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like `"` or `'`. By default, `read_csv()` assumes that the quoting character will be `"`. What argument do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame using `read_delim()`?

```
"x,y\n1,'a,b'"
```


#### Answer
For `read_delim()`, we will will need to specify a delimiter, in this case `","`, and a `quote` argument.

```{r DIQ3, exercise = TRUE}
x <- "x,y\n1,'a,b'"
read_delim(x, ",", quote = "'")
```



### Question 4 {.tabset}

#### Question 
Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code?

```
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")
read_csv("a;b\n1;3")
```

#### Answer
1. Only two columns are specified in the header “a” and “b”, but the rows have three columns, so the last column is dropped.
```{r DIQ4a}
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
```

2. The numbers of columns in the data do not match the number of columns in the header (three). In row one, there are only two values, so column `c` is set to missing. In row two, there is an extra value, and that value is dropped.
```{r DIQ4b}
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
```

3. Both “a” and “b” are treated as character vectors since they contain non-numeric strings. This may have been intentional, or the author may have intended the values of the columns to be “1,2” and “a,b”.
```{r DIQ4c}
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")
```

4. The values are separated by “;” rather than “,”. Use read_csv2() instead:
```{r DIQ4d}
read_csv("a;b\n1;3")

read_csv2("a;b\n1;3")
```



## Tidy Data

Remember that often we have data that is already "tidy". This means that every row corresponds to an observation, every column is a variable, and every cell is a value (see table below).

<center>

![Illustration of tidy data, from the R for Data Science book book](images/tidyData.png){width=100%}

</center>

It's possible, however, that we have untidy data. This happens when 

**Exercise:** Why are we interested in having `tidy` data? (There are several possible solutions to this very open-ended question). 

```{r tidyQ, exercise=TRUE}
# You don't need to put anything here, it's just a placeholder for the solution
```

```{r tidyQ-solution}
# There are many reasons why we might want to have tidy data, but according to Hadley Whickam (R4DS textbook):
# 
# 1. There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

# 2. There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.
```

**Exercise:** Is the dataset below in `tidy` format? If not, how can we fix it? 

```{r huronLevel, exercise=TRUE}
huron_level <- read_csv("data/huron_level.csv", comment = "#")
head(huron_level)
```

```{r huronLevel-hint-1}
# Look at the names of the columns. Are these names really variables of an observation, or are they instead times when observations are obtained? 
```

```{r huronLevel-hint-2}
# The data here seems like they are too "wide": each column really identifies a month and not a new variable! Maybe we should make the data "longer"... 
```

```{r huronLevel-solution}
huron_level %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -year, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "water_level"
  )
```

## Dates 

Dates are a common and tricky data type that we need to deal with often. Here are some things that we need to consider when working with dates: 

- Time intervals between dates are not always constant! For example, if I add 365 days to `2016-01-01`, I get `2016-12-31`!:

```{r}
as.Date("2016-01-01") + lubridate::days(365)
```

- Dates and times can usually be considered as continuous data types, but they are usually stored in files as strings or characters. 

- There is no standard way to store Dates and times. For example: `"2012-03-21"` vs `"03/21/12"`. 

**Exercise:** Convert the following strings into date objects. 

```{r convertDates, exercise=TRUE}
d1 <- "Jan 01, 2019"
d2 <- "11-28-95"
d3 <- "Nov 7, 7:49 PM"
```

```{r convertDates-hint}
# There were several functions that we used to "parse" dates:

# lubridate::ymd
# lubridate::mdy
# lubridate::ydm_hms
# readr::parse_date
# readr::parse_datetime
# and more! 

# Which do you think will be useful? 
```

```{r convertDates-solution}
d1 <- "Jan 01, 2019"
d2 <- "11-28-95"
d3 <- "November 07, '04, 10:04 PM"

# One possbile solution
readr::parse_date(d1, format = "%b %d, %Y")
lubridate::mdy(d2)
readr::parse_datetime(d3, "%B %d, '%y, %H:%M %p")
```




## Tables

We introduced our **model of rectangular data** as **lists of vectors**. 

There are several R classes that implement this idea:

>* `matrix`: all vectors of same type
>* `data.frame`: vectors of different types, fewer ammenities
>* `tibble`: vectros of different types, more features
>* `data.table`: for data too large to fit in memory


## Relational Data

### Inner Join

![](images/join-inner.png){width=90%}


The simplest type of join is the inner join. An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal. The output of an inner join is a new data frame that contains the key, the x values, and the y values. 

### Outer Joins

An inner join keeps observations that appear in both tables. An outer join keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables. There are three types of outer joins:

* A left join keeps all observations in x.
* A right join keeps all observations in y.
* A full join keeps all observations in x and y.

These joins work by adding an additional “virtual” observation to each table. This observation has a key that always matches (if no other key matches), and a value filled with NA.

Graphically, that looks like:

![](images/join-outer.png){width=90%}

### Semi-join

`semi_join(x, y)` keeps all the observations in `x` that are also in `y`.

![](images/join-semi.png){width=90%}


### Anti-join

The opposite of a semi-join is an anti-join: keeps all the observations in `x` that are not in `y`.

![](images/join-anti.png){width=90%}

## Keys

The variables used to connect each pair of tables are called keys. A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation.

There are two types of keys:

* A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, planes$tailnum is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the planes table.

* A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, flights$tailnum is a foreign key because it appears in the flights table where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

A variable can be both a primary key and a foreign key. For example, origin is part of the weather primary key, and is also a foreign key for the airports table.

If a table lacks a primary key, it’s sometimes useful to add one with mutate() and row_number(). That makes it easier to match observations if you’ve done some filtering and want to check back in with the original data. This is called a surrogate key.

A primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another table form a relation. Relations are typically one-to-many. For example, each flight has one plane, but each plane has many flights. In other data, you’ll occasionally see a 1-to-1 relationship. You can think of this as a special case of 1-to-many. 

### Exercises

What’s the primary key in the flights table? You might think it would be the date plus the flight or tail number. Check the two assumptions by the function `count()`

```{r primaryKey, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r primaryKey-hint}
flights %>% 
  count(...) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r primaryKey-solution}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

### Solution

Neither of those variable combinations are unique. The table `flights` doesn’t have an explicit primary key: each row is an observation, but no combination of variables reliably identifies it.
