sonnet18 <- "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date;\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\n\tSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\tSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

## Review: Relational Data

* Mutating joins: outer left, right, full and inner
* Keys spread across multiple columns (use `count(tbl, col1, col2) |> summarize(all(n < 2))` to see if `col1, col` form a primary key)
* "Natural joins": don't specify `by` argument, let R match column names (be careful!)
* Filtering joins: Equivalent to joining then `filter(!is.na(foreign_key_columns))`
* Set operations (items in vectors, rows in tables)

## Strings and Factors

R has two data types for representing categorical/nominal data types:

* Strings: character data
* Factors: integers representing categories with look up table for labels, can be ordered 

```{r}
example_str <- c("you", "say", "goodbye", "i", "say", "hello", "hello", "hello")
example_str
example_fct <- factor(example_str)
example_fct
```

## Strings vs. factors

Many times two types have the same function, why use one or the other?

- Want to order lexicographically: strings
- Want to order in other way: factors
- Treat as text (search, combine): strings
- Avoid errors from treating as text: factors

There used to be a space saving advantage to factors but that has been eliminated with newer versions of R.

## String basics

A string (or "character vector" in R) is character data enclosed in double `"` or single `'` quotes.

To include quotation marks inside, we need to **escape** them (like `,` in CSVs):
```{r}
baberuth <- "George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth Jr., a.k.a. \"the Bambino\" and \"the Sultan of Swat\""
cat(baberuth) # prints directly instead of displaying as escaped string
```

## Other special characters

Since `\` is used to escape things, if you need a literal backslash use `\\`. 
* New line: `\n`
* Tab: `\t`
* Unicode characters: `\unnnn` (u followed by 4 digit code)

This often come up in searching text for certain patterns.

## Combining strings

If we need to make strings out of other strings, we have two (more or less identical) functions:

* Old school: `paste` (joins with " ") and `paste0` (joins with ""); I frequently use these
* New school: `str_c` (joins with ""); used in our book

```{r}
paste("Section", c("100", "200", "300"), 
      "meets on", 
      c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"))
```
Notice: this is a vector of length 3, use `collapse = "SEP"` to make a single string from a vector.

## Exercise

Join the following using a new line characters `\n` (use the `sep` and `collapse` arguments as necessary) and indent the last two lines using tabs (`\t`). Demonstrate useing `cat`.

```{r sonnet18, exercise = TRUE}
line1 <- "Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,"
line2 <- "When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:"
line3 <- "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,"
line4 <- "So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
```

## Properties of strings

```{r, echo = FALSE}
line1 <- "Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,"
line2 <- "When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:"
line3 <- "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,"
line4 <- "So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
```

The `length` function in R will tell you how many items are in a vector:

```{r}
sonnet18_end <- c(line1, line2, line3, line4)
length(sonnet18_end)
```

To find the length of the strings in terms of characters:
```{r}
str_length(sonnet18_end) # base::nchar also works
```

## Subsetting

The `str_sub` function can retrieve or change **substrings**.

```{r}
str_sub(line1, 11, 20)
str_sub(line2, 36)
str_sub(line2, -8)
line4b <- line4
str_sub(line4b, 1, 10) <- "REMOVED"
line4b
```


## Splitting

Here's the full sonnet as a single string:
```{r}
sonnet18 <- "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date;\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\n\tSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\tSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
```

Let's split that up into individual lines as strings in a vector:
```{r}
sonnet18_lines <- str_split(sonnet18, "\n") # notice use of new line
sonnet18_lines
```

What is happening? Since `sonnet18` could have had multiple entries (vector), `str_split` returns a **list** with splits for each item in the vector:
```{r}
str_split(c("a b c", "d e"), " ")
```

In this case:
```{r}
sonnet18_lines <- sonnet18_lines[[1]] # [[]] for lists
```

## Exercise

**Tokenization** is the process many computer languages use to turn strings into discrete words. Use `str_split` to turn each line of `sonnet18_lines` into individual words. Use `unlist` on the result and answer the question: how many words are there?

```{r tokenize, exercise = TRUE}

```


## Looking for patterns: Regexes

A **REG**ular **EX**pression (**regex**) is a mini-language for writing patterns to match in strings.

They are used in R but also in other languages, the command line, databases, etc.

A regex is just a string, albeit one that looks rather strange.

## Regexes pattern matches

Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) match directly, most other characters with some later exceptions.

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "thee")
```

`.` will match exactly character (not newline)

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "th..")
```

Limited choices with `[]`
```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "th[aeiou][aeiou]")
```

Or classes of characters
```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "[A-Z]")
```

Negation choices with `[^]`
```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "th[aeiou][^aeiou ]")
```

## Other specials

To match periods we need to escape with `\\`

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines[14], "\\.")
```

Beginning of string is "^", end of string is "$" (can get literals with escapes):

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "^.. ")
```

Any white space (`\\s`) and make it optional `?`
```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "^\\s?.. ")
```

`\\d` matches digits.

## Repetition

* `?`: zero or one occurrence
* `*`: zero or many
* `+`: one or more

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "m+")
```

## Groups and Alternation

To select between alternates use a vertical bar `|`. We often combine this with groups based on `()`:

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "Thou|thou")
```

```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "fa(ir|de)")
```

Repeat patterns in `( )` using `\\NUMBER` (**backreferences**). Contiguous words with same letter: 
```{r}
str_view_all(sonnet18_lines, "(\\s|^)(.)[^ ]* \\2")
```
(notice "from fair" does not match because "fair from" already matched)

## Exercise

Find all contractions (words with "'" in them, but not possessive) in `sonnet18_lines` using `str_view_all`.

```{r contractions, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Using regular expressions

* Apply regexes to column names or levels
* Finding matches in columns
* Extract information from strings
* Break up strings (tokenize) on more complicated patterns

## Art and Emotion data set

```{r}
wikiart <- read_tsv("./data/WikiArt-Emotions-All.tsv.gz")
colnames(wikiart)
```

## Columns

With lots of columns, we could write things out direct, but better to use regex to find columns matching a pattern:

```{r}
select(wikiart, matches("anger"))
select(wikiart, matches("[tT]itle"))
select(wikiart, matches("[tT]itle."))
```

## Making more tidy

This has lots of **ratings**, let's put them into better columns.

```{r}
pivot_longer(wikiart, 
             matches(":"), 
             names_to = c("rating_type", "emotion"),
             names_sep = ":",
             values_to = "mean_annotation") -> wa_long

select(wa_long, Title, rating_type, emotion, mean_annotation)
```

## Find and replace

Hard to see in previous but there are spaces in the emotions:

```{r}
wa_long$emotion[1:5]
```

Let's remove all white space
```{r}
wa_long <- mutate(wa_long,
                  mean_annotation = str_replace(emotion, "\\s", ""))
wa_long$emotion[1:5]
```

## Improving rating type

```{r}
count(wa_long, rating_type)
```

Let's turn that into two columns:
```{r}
wa_long <- mutate(wa_long,
                  presented_image = str_detect(rating_type, "[iI]mage"),
                  presented_title = str_detect(rating_type, "[tT]itle"))

group_by(wa_long, rating_type) |> 
  summarize(sum(presented_image), sum(presented_title))
```
